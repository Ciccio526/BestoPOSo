What does BestoPOSo do?

  BestoPOSo is a POS system that enhances communication between the front and back of house of a resturaunt kitchen.
Just like a regular POS system, you can create food orders for customers, charging them a certain amount based on 
how much food they ordered.  Unlike other POS systems, BestoPOSo accurately tracks the current stock of every item within your menu.

How to use BestoPOSo?

When you run the program, you are given three options: create a menu, enter POS mode, and end of day report.  The latter two are only available
AFTER selecting the first option where you will create a save file and upload a menu by adding food items.  These food items must have a name, price, 
and initial stock.  Once you add a food item, the item will be saved, allowing you to access it again even after the program stops running.  Any time
that you open the add-item menu, Simply click the wipe button if you wish to clear the current save, or ammend/use existing save if you wish to add to
or create a new saved menu.  

Once you have your menu squared away, you may then access the POS mode and End of Day Mode:

POS Mode:
  This is where you will be able to start orders, upload menu items to those orders, and submit orders.  In addition to that, you are even given the ability
  to check the list of orders being prepped, and are able to edit them with our two different delete buttons, once that deletes by index, and one that works
  like a backspace.   

End of Day Mode:
  This is where our project comes to an end.  End of day mode requires no inputs by the user and presents the total sales from all of the orders made
  throughout the day.  


Program was made using Qt for Visual Studio 2022
